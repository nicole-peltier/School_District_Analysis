# School_District_Analysis


## Overview
The purpose of this project is to analyze the high schools math, reading, and overall scores while looking at the different sizes of the schools as well as the different budgets within the district.
The files show academic dishonesty for reading and math scores for Thomas High School ninth graders. That being said, the original analysis needs to be altered so that the ninth graders scores for Thomas High School are not included.

## Results

  - Average Math Score was 79.0 and decreased to 78.9

  - The Percent Passing Reading was 86% and decreased to 64.9%
  - The Overall Passing Percent was 65% and decreased to 64.9%
